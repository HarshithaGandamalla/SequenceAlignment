# SequenceAlignment
Implementation of sequence alignment using the following algorithms are available.

Global alignment
Local alignment
End space free (dove-tail) alignment according to Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman methods.
Program will get the following as input:

an integer that denotes which alignment method will be used. Use 1, 2, and 3 for global, local, and dove-tail alignment respectively.
name of the le that contains query sequences in Fasta format
name of the le that contains database sequences in Fasta format
name of the le that contains the alphabet
name of the le that contains the scoring matrix for the given alphabet
a positive integer k that indicates the number of nearest neighbors 1
a negative integer m that indicates the gap penalty.
